# ⏳ Do It Today - Darius Foroux

I have decided to read more than 100 books this year (2022). So, I bought around 15+ books in bulk from Flipkart and Amazon. Do It Today came up in suggestion list while browsing for self help trending books and got my attention with the title and subtitle as I am recurrent procrastinator ( at least when I think about myself).  I do start things and leave them without any further  thoughts about it. I am a computer science graduate and I have started so many computer science projects but I didn't even complete at least one project. As of today (15 March, 2022), I don't even have a Portfolio  project but had different unfinished GitHub repositories. Enough about my procrastination, lets dive into the summary of Do It Today. Just a reminder that this looks more like a notes than summary.



From the title itself we can summarised the philosophy of the book into three words: "_Do it today_"

It all starts with a question _"Who are we?"_ and _" where are we investing our majority of our time?"_&#x20;

> You are not your job, you are not how much money you have in the bank." - Fight Club (Movie)

The author believes **we are our actions**.

Most people end up trading time for money during their life.



_Do It Today_ is path and blueprint for overcoming the endless procrastination, improving productivity , and getting more things done.



We need to decide what's important to us. When you decide what want to do something, you also must have map that takes you there. In life, we have to make that map.



This book  is divided into three different parts.

* Part I: Overcoming Procrastination
* Part II: Improving Productivity
* Part III: Achieving More

Every day, we accumulate stuff. We accumulate a lot of ideas. We need to Eliminate the things that makes our life hard. When you lack focus, ask yourself:

Life is already hard enough. Don't make it harder.

#### How to beat procrastination

> "You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today." -- Abraham Lincoln&#x20;

When you procrastinate, you might feel better for short time, but you will suffer long time. Procrastination is a sign of poor self-regulation.

Willpower doesn't work. System's do.Having self-discipline, routines, systems, frameworks are actual freedom but people think it as opposite.

Effective techniques:

* Deadlines
* Accountability
* Intervals while working
* Exercise

Productive =>being Effective => getting the right things done.

Results matter the most.

Simple Exercise:

* **Know Thy Time** - find where your time goes by logging every hour of your day for 2 weeks with paper and pen. \_\_Activity Log\_\_
* **Identify The Non-Productive Work and Eliminate the time wasters.** - go through the activity log one by and decide what happen when we stop doing it.  If _nothing would happen_ , try to remove that activity from your time.
