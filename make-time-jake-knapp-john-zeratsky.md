# ⏲ Make Time - Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky



This book is about making time for things that matter

Two very powerful forces compete for every minute of your time

* Busy Band Wagon
* Infinity Pools

### Most of our time is Spent by Default

Default means the way something works when you first using it.

React to what's in front of you. Be responsive. Fill your time, be efficient, and get more done are default rules of the Busy Band Wagon.

Busy Band Wagon → endless tasks

Infinity Pools         → endless distraction

The faster you run on the hamster wheel, the faster it spins.

#### Four Lessons from the Design Sprint Laboratory

1. Something magic happens when you start the day with one high-priority goals.

&#x20;     Monday        → Map of the Problem

&#x20;     Tuesday        → Sketching the Solution

&#x20;     Wednesday  → Deciding the which solution

&#x20;    Thursday      → Building a prototype

&#x20;    Friday           →Testing

1. We get more done when we banned devices.
2. The importance of energy for focused work and clear thinking.
3. Experimenting allowed us to improve the process.

### How Make Time Works

Make time is just 4 steps, Repeated everyday.

→Choose a single highlight to prioritize in yourself.

→Stay laser focused on that highlight.

→Reflect on the day with few simple notes.

* **Highlight**: Start each day by choosing a focal point.
* **Laser**: Beat distraction to make time for your highlight.(Schedule time to react to check mail.)
* **Energize**: Use the body to recharge the brain.
* **Reflect**: Adjust and improve your system.(Before going to bed, take notes.)

The make time tactics: Pick, Test, Repeat.

No perfection required: Perfection is distraction.

> We do not remember days, we remember moments. ——-Cesare Pauese

What will be the highlight of your day?

By choosing a Highlight gives a chance to be proactive about how you spend your time instead of letting technology, office defaults, and other people set your agenda. Your Highlight gives each day a focal point.

### Three ways to pick your highlight

What do I want to be the highlight of my day?

1. **Urgency**: what's the most pressing thing I have to do today?
2. **Satisfaction**: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction?
3. **Joy**: When I reflect on today, What will bring me the most joy?
