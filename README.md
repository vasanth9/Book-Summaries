# ðŸ•Š As a Man Thinketh - James Allen

> _"They themselves are makers of themselves."_

#### 1. Thought and Character

> _"As a man thinketh in his heart so is he"_

A man is literally _**what he thinks**_, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.

As plant springs from  the seed, so every act of a man springs from the thought.

**You are the master of your Fate**:   As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his                 own thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and  contains within himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may make himself what he wills.

**Seek and You shall Find**: If a man watch, control, and alter his thoughts, tracing their effects and linking cause and effect of his actions can find what he wants.

#### 2. Effect of Thought on Circumstances

Man's mind may be linked to a garden. Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind weeding out all the wrong , useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful and pure thoughts.

> Man do not attract that what they _**want**_, but that which they _**are**._

&#x20;Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves.

**You are what you think**: nothing can come from corn but corn, nothing can come from nettles but nettles.

Suffering is _**always**_ the effect of wrong thought in some direction.

> A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results
>
> on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly , yet surely, shape his circumstances.

#### 3. Effect of Thought on Health and The Body

Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.

Clean thoughts makes clean habits.&#x20;

#### 4. Thought and Purpose

Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment.

Thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplished anything, and never can.

**Eliminate Doubt and Fear**: He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure.

#### 5.The Thought-Factor in Achievement

> All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.
>
> As he thinks, so he is; as he continues  to think, so he remains.

Victories attained by right thought can only be maintained by watchfulness. Many give way when success is assured, and rapidly fall back into failure.

He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly.&#x20;

#### 6.Visions and Ideals

> He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it.....
>
> Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become.

**There is no Such Thing as Luck**: In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of effort is the measure of the result. Chance is not.

#### 7.Serenity

> The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good..
>
> The strong, calm man is always loved and revered.

Calmness of mind is the result of long and patient effort in self control.

Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power.
